* Advent of code solutions
This is small project made to gather various [[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] solutions written over the years in various languages.

The solutions have often been used to learn or practice a new language, so you should not expect high quality.
They have also been written over several years, on different systems, and using various tooling, so nothing is guaranteed to be up to date or even runnable.
